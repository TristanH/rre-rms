< Flights:
< 
< I am travelling most of the time, and most of my trips include several
< stops.  Chances are your city is neither the first nor the last stop
< in the trip.  So please don't make assumptions about the itinerary;
< instead, please ask me for whatever information you need.
< 
< Many organizations ask to buy the tickets and send them to me.  That
< is ok with me, but it typically assumes the trip goes to just one
< city.  That approach usually won't work for a multi-destination trip,
< unless you want to pay for the whole trip.  So normally I buy the
< tickets myself and get reimbursed by the various places I am visiting.
< For a multi-destination trip, we will need to agree on what parts of
< the travel expenses you should cover.
< 
< Some organizations feel that hospitality calls for providing me with a
< business class ticket.  That is indeed more comfortable, but an
< economy class seat is good enough even on an overnight flight if it is
< a window seat.  Meanwhile, speaking is my main source of income, and
< the extra price of a business class ticket would be a lot more useful
< for me if I can spend it on something else.  So if you were thinking
< of spending extra for business class, how about if you pay the
< extra to me as a speaker's fee instead?
< 
< We should plan for me to arrive at least 24 hours before the speech;
< that way, even if the flight is cancelled, there is a good chance I
< can still arrive in time for the speech.

< Paying me a reimbursement or a fee:

< never pays for my travel.  The FSF welcomes donations, but please make

< afterward would mean accounting headaches as well as extra work.
< 
< My assistant is not involved with my finances, so he cannot help you
< with that issue.  Please send questions about payments to me directly.
< 
< If you pay me by check, and you're not in the US, make sure to get a
< check that lists a corresponding US bank--otherwise it will cost me a
< fee to deposit the check.  Please mail the check to:

<   545 Tech Sq rm 425
<   Cambridge, MA 02139
<   USA
< 
< Do not mail it to the FSF!
< 
< A wire transfer is also a good method of payment.  I will send you the
< coordinates; ask if you need them.  But note that a fee is always
< charged for making the transfer--please don't take that out of what
< you've agreed to pay me.
< 
< Cash is also fine.
< 
< If you are outside the US, please convert your currency to dollars in
< your bank, then use one of the above methods to pay me the dollars.
< My bank gives very bad exchange rates; yours is surely better.
< 
< If you want an invoice, I will be glad to give you one.  Let's work
< out what it should say by email before I arrive.  Please also check
< before the visit whether you need any other forms, such as tax forms.
< I would like to be able to take care of any necessary forms while I am
