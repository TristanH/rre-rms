<

< hostile bias.  See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html
< for explanation.  I hope you will decide to reject that expression, as
< I do; but in any case, don't use it in connection with my speech.

< 
< Printing Free Software, Free Society
< 
< Please print copies of my book, Free Software, Free Society, to sell
< at the event if you can.  The English version (230 pages) is available
< in http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/fsfs/rms-essays.ps and the Spanish
< version (318 pages) is in
< http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/fsfs/free_software.es.pdf.
< 
< If you use ordinary copying and avoid fancy covers, you can sell them
< for two or three times the cost of copying, and they will still be
< cheap enough that many people will buy them.  Then you can give the
< remaining money to the FSF, keeping some for your organization.
< 
< In the US, Canada, Spain and Italy you can obtain published copies in
< English, Spanish, and Italian.
< 
< 
< At the speech:
< 
< Please arrange for someone to hand out and collect our "contact cards".
< 
<     FSF would like to keep in touch with those who support us, to give
<     you updates on what we are doing and how you can help.  If you are
<     willing, Dr. Stallman asks that you fill out these contact cards,
<     which he can take back with him so you can receive updates about
<     FSF.  The FSF will not release this information unless forced to.
< 
< Please talk with my assistant to arrange this.
< 
< 
< Changes of plans:
< 
< Don't assume that I can still come if you change the date.  My
< schedule is tight.  If you change the date by even one day, I may be
< unable to come.  However, I will certainly be flexible if there is no
< obstacle.  Please consult with me before making any change, and I will
< see what I can do.
< 
< 
< Scheduling other meetings:
< 
< I have agreed to give a speech for you, and if the press wants to talk
< with me, I will do that for the sake of the cause.  However, if you
< would like me to give additional speeches or go to additional
< meetings, please ask me first.  Please ask me about *each* activity
< you would like me to perform.
< 
< Many people assume that because I am traveling, I am having a
< vacation--that I have no other work to do, so I can spend the whole
< day speaking or meeting with people.  Some hosts even feel that they
< ought to try to fill up my time as a matter of good hospitality.
< Alas, it's not that way for me.
< 
< The fact is, I have no vacations.  (Don't feel sorry for me; idleness
< is not something I wish for.)  I have to spend 6 to 8 hours *every
< day* doing my usual work, which is responding to email about the GNU
< Project and the Free Software Movement.  Work comes in every day for
< me, and if I skip it one day, I have to catch up another day.  During
< the week I usually fall behind; on weekends I try to catch up.
< 
< Traveling takes up time, so I will be extra busy during my visit.  And
< it might be nice if I could do at least an hour or two of sightseeing
< during the visit.  So please ask me *in advance* about *each*
< additional speech, meeting, or other activity that would take time.  I
< don't mind being asked, and I may say yes, but I also may say no.
< 
< Remember that an additional speech, even if it is just a one-hour
< speech, probably takes up two hours counting questions, autographs,
< etc.  And then there is the travel time.
< 
< 
< Interviews:
< 
< I am glad to give interviews to the press about the GNU system, but
< before I do, I want to be sure they will not repeat the two common
< mistakes (calling the whole system "Linux" and associating GNU or me
< with "open source").  Please explain this, and ask the journalist if
< he will agree to call the system "GNU/Linux" in the article, and to
< make it clear that our work is "free software" not "open source".
< Recommend reading http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html and
< http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html for
< explanations of these issues.  If the journalist agrees, then I agree
< to an interview.  Please have this discussion by email, and save the
< messages in both directions.
< 
< Sometimes a journalist gives a vaguely affirmative-sounding or
< sympathetic response which does not really answer "yes".  Examples are
< "I will do this as much as I can" and "I understand the distinction."
< Such an answer is actually just "maybe", so when you receive one,
< please ask for clarification.  If he says that the editor has the
< final decision, please respond with "Would you please consult the
< editor now, and tell us a firm decision?"
< 
< Also please ask journalists to *see my speech* before the interview.
< My speeches are not technical; they focus on precisely the sort of
< philosophical questions that a journalist would probably want to
< cover.  If the journalist does not attend my speech, he will probably
< start by asking me to answer the same questions that I answer in the
< speech.  That is inefficient.
< 
< Please ask each journalist to agree to make a recording of the
< interview.  Written notes are not reliable, so I have decided not to
< do that sort of interview any more.
< 
< It is also a good idea for the journalist to read
< http://www.gnu.org/gnu/the-gnu-project.html and some of the articles
< in http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/ before the interview.  Those
< articles provide important background.  This is especially important
< for anyone who cannot come to my speech first.
< 
< I am willing to meet with any number of journalists, but if there are
< many, I can't meet all of them individually (it would take too much
< time).  So what I will do is give private interviews to 2 or maybe 3
< of them, whichever ones you think are most important, and see the rest
< of them as a group (i.e. in a press conference).
< 
< You and your associates can judge better than I do which journalists
< and which publications I should focus on.  So I would like you to
< advise me about that.  Please try to judge both the importance of the
< publication and the merits (intelligence, attention to accuracy,
< openness of mind, and absence of bias) of the journalist, if you can.
< 
< If you schedule a press conference or group interview, please *plan
< the time of my speech to allow the inteview after it*.  It may be a
< good idea to find out from journalists what times are good for them,
< then schedule the conference, then schedule the speech before it.
< This way, they will all be able to get the full picture.
< 
< 
< Recording my speech:
< 
< Please do record the speech if you can.  We are always looking for
< good recordings of my speeches, both audio and video, to put on line.
< However, please do not record using a system that produces a
< proprietary format such as Windows Media Player format.  I will not
< speak to make a recording that requires non-free software to be
< viewed.
< 
< The GNU Project keeps an on-line audio and video collection of speech
< recordings in audio-video.gnu.org.  If you are making an audio or
< video recording of my speech, please write to Nick Hill

< you on how to make a recording that is good for further use, and can
< arrange to install your recording on our site.
