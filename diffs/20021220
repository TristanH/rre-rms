> For Against Software Patents, you can use this abstract:
> 
>     Richard Stallman will explain how software patents obstruct
>     software development.  Software patents are patents that cover
>     software ideas.  They restrict the development of software, so
>     that every design decision brings a risk of getting sued.  Patents
>     in other fields restrict factories, but software patents restrict
>     every computer user.  Economic research shows that they even
>     retard progress.

> Participation in a larger event:

> I am selective about what sorts of events I am willing to participate

> decision about whether I really want to participate.
> 
> I usually decline to participate in "open source" or "Linux" events.

> Erecting a larger event:

> If you are thinking of erecting a larger event around my speech,
> please talk with me about the plans for such a larger event before
> proceeding with them.  I want to make sure the event entirely supports

> Sponsors:

> If corporations sponsor my talk, I am willing to include a small

> insists on more than that, we have to do without that sponsor.

> If my speech is part of a pre-existing larger event that I have agreed
> to participate in, I can't impose such conditions for the whole event.
> However, if banners will be on display next to me while I am speaking,
> that is rather obnoxious; if they advertise organizations that I
> disapprove of on ethical grounds (which is not unlikely) I would want
> to take them down, cover them up, or turn them off during my speech.

< If you wish, it is ok to explain free software by saying that "since
< 1998, another group has used the term `open source' to describe a
< similar activity."  That will tell people that my work has a
< relationship with something else they may have heard of, without
< implying that term ought to be applied to my work.
< 
< The other great mistake is speaking of a "Linux operating system".
< The system in question, the system that Debian and Red Hat distribute,
< the system that 20 million people use, is basically the GNU operating
< system, with Linux added as the kernel.  When people call our system
< "Linux", they deny us the credit for our work, and this is not right.
< (See http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html for more explanation.)
< 
< In all the publicity, in the titles and description of the session,
< track, event, etc., please call this combined operating system
< "GNU/Linux", if and when you have reason to refer to it.  Likewise,
< please don't use a penguin in connection with my talk or in any way as
< a symbol for my work.  The penguin stands for "Linux".  The symbol of
< GNU is a gnu, so if you want to use a graphical image to symbolize my
< work, please use a gnu.

< I am glad to give interviews to the press about the GNU Project.
